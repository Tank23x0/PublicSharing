# PublicSharing — Security-First Automation & Threat-Hunting Toolkit

A curated, security-first library of **650+ production-ready scripts** and playbooks for **sysadmins, security engineers, and incident responders**. This repo is built for **knowledge-sharing**: clear, auditable automation that helps peers **detect faster, respond smarter, and operate safer** across enterprise environments.

## 🧭 Mission

PublicSharing exists to **share battle-tested automation and threat-hunting building blocks** with the broader IT and security community. Every script is created with a **security-first mindset**, emphasizing least privilege, safe defaults, clear logging, and operational hygiene.

## 🧠 Professional Profile (Quick Highlights)

- **AI Security Threat Hunter** with a strong focus on **telemetry-driven detection, triage efficiency, and operational resilience**.
- **Multi-disciplinary engineer** spanning **security operations, identity, endpoint, cloud, M365, and infrastructure**.
- **20+ years** of Windows Server & enterprise systems management.
- **Automation-first mindset** with deep experience in **PowerShell, Bash, and scheduled task orchestration**.
- Passionate about **LLMs and AI-assisted security workflows**, from **lightweight models on Raspberry Pi** to **frontier models like Opus 4.5**, plus **ClawDBot/MoltBot** and widely adopted open-weight and proprietary model stacks.

## 🔐 Security-First Engineering Philosophy

I build automation that **respects security boundaries and operational reality**:

- **Safe-by-default** operations with confirmations before destructive actions
- **Clean logging** for auditability and incident traceability
- **Module dependency checks** to reduce runtime surprises
- **Compatibility across hybrid environments** (on-prem + cloud)

## 🤖 AI & LLM Passion

I actively integrate **LLMs into security workflows**—from lightweight **local models** to enterprise-grade systems:

- **Model range**: Raspberry Pi–scale local models → frontier-grade platforms (including **Opus 4.5**) 
- **Agents & tooling**: **ClawDBot / MoltBot**, prompt-driven triage accelerators, and knowledge synthesis automation
- **Focus**: **security-first AI**, minimizing hallucination risk through grounding, validation, and deterministic checks

## ⚙️ Automation Before AI (Because Operations Matter)

Long before AI, I built automation that **keeps environments stable and compliant**:

- **PowerShell + Bash** for infra hygiene, fleet compliance, and audit readiness
- **Windows scheduled tasks + Linux cron** for reliable, repeatable ops
- **Environment-aware execution** (dev/test/prod parity, change control, staged rollouts)
