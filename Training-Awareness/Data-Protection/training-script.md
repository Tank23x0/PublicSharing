Not all data is created equal. Understanding classification helps you handle information appropriately.

**[ON SCREEN: Classification pyramid]**

**Public**
Information freely available—marketing materials, public announcements. No restrictions.

**Internal**
General business information—internal policies, org charts. Not for external sharing.

**Confidential**
Sensitive business data—financial reports, contracts, employee records. Restricted access.

**Restricted/Highly Confidential**
Most sensitive data—customer PII, credit cards, health records, trade secrets. Strictest controls required.

Always handle data according to its classification. When in doubt, treat it as confidential.
