# Data Protection - Key Talking Points

## Why Data Protection Matters
- Average breach cost: $4.45 million
- Regulatory fines: Up to $20M or 4% of global revenue (GDPR)
- 65% of customers lose trust after breach
- Personal liability for gross negligence
- Legal requirements (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)

## Data Classification Levels

| Level | Description | Examples | Handling |
|-------|-------------|----------|----------|
| Public | Freely shareable | Marketing, press releases | No restrictions |
| Internal | Business use only | Policies, org charts | Don't share externally |
| Confidential | Restricted access | Financials, HR records | Need-to-know, encrypted |
| Restricted | Highest sensitivity | PII, health records, IP | Strictest controls |

**When in doubt, treat it as confidential.**
