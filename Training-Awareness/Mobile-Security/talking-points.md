# Mobile Device Security - Key Talking Points

## Why Mobile Security Matters
- Mobile devices contain both personal and work data
- Phones are always connected, always on
- Smaller screens make threats harder to detect
- 60% of organizational endpoints are now mobile
- Average smartphone has access to 80+ accounts/services

## Mobile Threat Landscape

### Common Threats
- **Smishing** - SMS phishing attacks
- **Malicious apps** - Fake or trojanized applications
- **Lost/stolen devices** - Physical security
- **Unsecured WiFi** - Man-in-the-middle attacks
- **QR code attacks** - Malicious links via QR codes
- **Juice jacking** - Data theft via public USB charging

### Mobile-Specific Risks
- Apps request excessive permissions
- Users less suspicious on mobile
- Difficult to verify URLs on small screens
- Always-on connectivity increases attack surface
- Personal/work data often mixed

## Device Protection Basics

### Screen Lock
- 6+ digit PIN or complex password
- Enable biometrics (fingerprint/face)
- Auto-lock: 1-2 minutes maximum
- Never share unlock codes

### Software Updates
- Enable automatic updates
- Update apps regularly
- Don't ignore security patches
- Replace unsupported devices

### Find My Device
- Enable iOS: Find My iPhone
- Enable Android: Find My Device
- Know how to locate, lock, wipe
- Test features before you need them

### Encryption
- Ensure device encryption is enabled
- Enabled by default on modern devices
- Requires strong screen lock to be effective

## App Security

### Safe App Installation
- Official stores only (App Store, Google Play)
- Research before installing (reviews, ratings)
- Avoid excessive permissions
- Never jailbreak/root work devices

### Permission Management
- Review permissions before granting
- Question unnecessary permissions
- Regularly audit app permissions
- Revoke access that isn't needed

### Work Apps
- Use only approved apps for work
- Separate work/personal when possible
- Follow MDM requirements
- Report suspicious app behavior

## Secure Connections

### WiFi
- Avoid unknown networks
- Use VPN on public WiFi
- Verify network names
- Disable auto-connect to open networks

### Bluetooth
- Turn off when not in use
- Don't pair with unknown devices
- Use non-discoverable mode
- Unpair unused devices

### Charging Safety
- Avoid public USB charging stations
- Use your own charger/adapter
- Consider USB data blockers
- Use AC outlets instead of USB

## Lost or Stolen Device Response

### Immediate Actions
1. Try to locate via Find My Device
2. Remote lock if unrecoverable
3. Remote wipe if sensitive data at risk
4. Report to IT Security immediately
5. Change passwords for accessed accounts

### Prevention
- Never leave devices unattended
- Don't store in visible locations (cars)
- Be aware in public spaces
- Track devices during travel

## BYOD Considerations
- Separate work profiles when available
- Accept MDM requirements
- Understand what company can see/do
- Report lost devices even if personal
- Wipe work data when leaving company

## Key Statistics
- 33% of mobile malware is on enterprise devices
- 40% of mobile users have clicked suspicious links
- Average lost device costs organization $50,000+
- 71% of breaches involve mobile devices

## Key Principle
> "Your phone is a computer with all your data—treat it like one."
