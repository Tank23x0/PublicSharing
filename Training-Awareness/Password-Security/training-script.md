## [INTRO - 0:00-0:30]

**[NARRATOR]**

Your password is the key to your digital life—your email, your files, your banking, your identity. Yet most people still use passwords that can be cracked in seconds.

Today, we're going to transform how you think about passwords and show you how to create unbreakable credentials without losing your mind.

## [SECTION 1: The Problem with Passwords - 0:30-1:30]

**[NARRATOR]**

Let's start with some uncomfortable truths.

**[ON SCREEN: Statistics with visual impact]**

The most common passwords in 2024 are still "123456", "password", and "qwerty". If any of these look familiar, you're not alone—but you ARE at risk.

Here's how fast modern computers can crack passwords:

**[ON SCREEN: Cracking time visualization]**

- 6 characters, lowercase only: **Instant**
- 8 characters, mixed case: **22 minutes**
- 10 characters, with symbols: **5 years**
- 16 characters, passphrase: **Millions of years**

Length beats complexity. Every time.

## [SECTION 2: Creating Strong Passwords - 1:30-2:45]

**[NARRATOR]**

Forget what you learned about passwords in 2005. Here's what actually works today:

**[ON SCREEN: The passphrase method]**

**Method 1: The Passphrase**

Instead of "P@ssw0rd!", try "correct-horse-battery-staple" or "MyDogAte3PurpleSocks!"

A passphrase is:
- Longer (more secure)
- Easier to remember
- Harder to crack

**[ON SCREEN: The sentence method]**

**Method 2: The Sentence Method**

Take a memorable sentence: "My first car was a 1999 Honda Civic!"
Convert it to: "Mfcwa1999HC!"

**[ON SCREEN: Password manager demonstration]**

**Method 3: Password Managers (The Best Way)**

Use a password manager to generate and store unique, random passwords for every account.

You remember ONE master password. The manager handles everything else.

Popular options: Bitwarden (free), 1Password, LastPass, Dashlane

## [SECTION 3: Multi-Factor Authentication - 2:45-3:45]

**[NARRATOR]**

Even the strongest password can be stolen. That's why you need a backup: Multi-Factor Authentication, or MFA.

**[ON SCREEN: MFA explanation graphic]**

MFA requires two or more forms of proof:
- Something you **KNOW** (password)
- Something you **HAVE** (phone, security key)
- Something you **ARE** (fingerprint, face)

With MFA enabled, even if someone steals your password, they still can't get in without your second factor.

**[ON SCREEN: MFA options ranking]**

**Best to Good MFA options:**
1. Hardware security keys (YubiKey) - Most secure
2. Authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy) - Very secure
3. Push notifications - Secure
4. SMS codes - Better than nothing, but vulnerable to SIM swapping

Enable MFA on everything that supports it—especially email, banking, and work accounts.

## [SECTION 4: Password Don'ts - 3:45-4:30]

**[NARRATOR]**

Now let's cover what NOT to do.

**[ON SCREEN: Red X marks appearing with each point]**

❌ **Never reuse passwords across sites**
One breach exposes all your accounts.

❌ **Never share passwords**
Not with IT, not with your boss, not with anyone.

❌ **Never write passwords on sticky notes**
That "hidden" note under your keyboard isn't hidden.

❌ **Never use personal information**
Your pet's name, birthday, or anniversary are easily guessed.

❌ **Never send passwords via email or text**
These can be intercepted or stored forever.

## [OUTRO - 4:30-5:00]

**[NARRATOR]**

Strong passwords combined with MFA are your digital armor. They're not just protecting your accounts—they're protecting your identity, your organization, and everyone who trusts you with their data.

Take action today:
1. Set up a password manager
2. Enable MFA on your critical accounts
3. Update any weak passwords

Your security starts with your password. Make it count.
