# Password Security - Key Talking Points

## The Password Problem
- 81% of data breaches involve weak or stolen passwords
- Most common passwords: "123456", "password", "qwerty"
- Average person has 100+ online accounts
- Password reuse is the #1 security mistake

## Password Strength = Length
| Password Type | Crack Time |
|--------------|------------|
| 6 chars, lowercase | Instant |
| 8 chars, mixed case | 22 minutes |
| 10 chars + symbols | 5 years |
| 16 char passphrase | Millions of years |

**Length > Complexity** (always)

## Creating Strong Passwords

### Method 1: Passphrases
- Use 4+ random words: `correct-horse-battery-staple`
- Add variation: `MyDogAte3PurpleSocks!`
- Easy to remember, hard to crack

### Method 2: Sentence Method
- Memorable sentence → abbreviation
- "My first car was a 1999 Honda Civic!" → `Mfcwa1999HC!`

### Method 3: Password Managers (Recommended)
- Generate unique passwords for every account
- Remember only ONE master password
- Options: Bitwarden (free), 1Password, LastPass, Dashlane

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

### Three Factors
1. **Something you KNOW** - Password, PIN
2. **Something you HAVE** - Phone, security key
3. **Something you ARE** - Fingerprint, face

### MFA Options (Best to Acceptable)
1. Hardware security keys (YubiKey)
2. Authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy)
3. Push notifications
4. SMS codes (vulnerable to SIM swapping)

## Password Don'ts ❌
- Never reuse passwords across sites
- Never share passwords with anyone
- Never write passwords on sticky notes
- Never use personal info (birthdays, pet names)
- Never send passwords via email/text
- Never save passwords in browsers on shared computers

## Action Items
1. Install and set up a password manager
2. Enable MFA on all critical accounts
3. Audit and update weak passwords
4. Never reuse passwords

## Key Statistics
- 59% of people reuse passwords across sites
- 23 million accounts use "123456" as password
- MFA blocks 99.9% of automated attacks
- Average cost of a credential-based breach: $4.5M
