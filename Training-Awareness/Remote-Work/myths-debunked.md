# Remote Work Security Myths vs. Reality

## ❌ Myth 1: "My home network is private and secure"

### ✅ Reality:
Home networks have significant vulnerabilities:
- Default router passwords are publicly known
- Many home routers have unpatched vulnerabilities
- Neighbors and nearby attackers can attempt to access
- IoT devices (smart TVs, cameras) may have weak security
- Family members might download malware

Your home network needs active security management.

## ❌ Myth 2: "VPN is only necessary on public WiFi"

### ✅ Reality:
VPN protects you everywhere:
- Home networks can be compromised
- VPN encrypts all traffic end-to-end
- Protects against ISP monitoring
- Company policy may require it for all work
- Provides consistent security regardless of location

Use VPN for all work activities.

## ❌ Myth 3: "Attackers don't target home workers"

### ✅ Reality:
Remote workers are prime targets:
- 47% increase in phishing targeting remote workers
- Attackers know home security is often weaker
- Remote workers have access to valuable systems
- Less security oversight at home
- Easier to social engineer isolated workers

You may be specifically targeted because you work from home.

## ❌ Myth 4: "It's fine to mix personal and work activities on my work laptop"

### ✅ Reality:
Mixing creates serious risks:
- Personal browsing can introduce malware
- Personal apps may not meet security standards
- Data can accidentally mix between contexts
- Incident investigation becomes complicated
- Violates most acceptable use policies

Keep work and personal completely separate.

## ❌ Myth 5: "I'm safe because I work behind a NAT router"

### ✅ Reality:
NAT provides minimal security:
- NAT is not a firewall
- Malware initiates outbound connections that bypass NAT
- Phishing doesn't care about your network architecture
- Router vulnerabilities can be exploited externally
- Once one device is compromised, others are exposed

NAT is not a security feature.

## ❌ Myth 6: "I don't need to lock my screen at home"

### ✅ Reality:
Unlocked screens at home still pose risks:
- Family members might accidentally access sensitive data
- Visitors could see confidential information
- Creates bad habits that carry to other locations
- Children playing could send embarrassing messages
- Compliance requires consistent screen locking

Lock your screen every time, everywhere.

## ❌ Myth 7: "Phone calls are always more secure than email"

### ✅ Reality:
Phone security has its own challenges:
- Voice phishing (vishing) targets remote workers
- Caller ID can be spoofed
- Others might overhear sensitive discussions
- Smart speakers might be listening
- Phone isn't encrypted end-to-end

Verify callers and use secure spaces for sensitive calls.

---

## ❌ Myth 8: "Smart home devices don't affect work security"

### ✅ Reality:
IoT devices can impact work security:
- Smart speakers may record conversations
- Smart cameras could capture screens
- IoT devices often have poor security
- They share the same network as work devices
- Compromised IoT devices can attack other network devices

Consider a separate network for IoT devices.

---

## ❌ Myth 9: "I'll recognize a phishing attack—I'm not in the office"

### ✅ Reality:
Remote work makes phishing MORE effective:
- Harder to verify requests with colleagues
- "IT support" scams more believable when remote
- Isolation increases likelihood of falling for urgency
- Can't walk over to confirm unusual requests
- Attackers specifically craft remote-work themed attacks

Stay more vigilant, not less.

---

## ❌ Myth 10: "Security incidents can wait until I'm back online/in office"

### ✅ Reality:
Time is critical for all incidents:
- Every hour increases potential damage
- Malware spreads regardless of your schedule
- Stolen credentials are used immediately
- Lost devices are being accessed now
- Remote reporting tools exist for this reason

Report incidents immediately, regardless of time or location.

## Key Takeaway

> **Remote work security essentials:**
> 1. **Secure your network** - Update router, strong WiFi password, consider segmentation
> 2. **Always use VPN** - For all work activities, not just public WiFi
> 3. **Separate work/personal** - Different devices, different activities
> 4. **Stay vigilant** - Phishing targets remote workers specifically
> 5. **Physical security still matters** - Screen privacy, document security, locked devices
>
> Your home is now the perimeter. Protect it like you would the office.
