# Incident Response Myths vs. Reality

## ❌ Myth 1: "If I report an incident, I'll get in trouble"

### ✅ Reality:
Reporting is expected and protected:
- Quick reporting limits damage and is rewarded
- Hiding incidents causes far more problems
- Organizations have no-blame policies for good-faith reports
- The cover-up is always worse than the incident
- Delayed reporting may actually result in discipline

You're a hero for reporting, not a problem.

## ❌ Myth 2: "It's probably nothing, so I shouldn't bother security"

### ✅ Reality:
"Probably nothing" often turns out to be something:
- Many major breaches started with "small" anomalies
- Security teams prefer false alarms to missed attacks
- Your "probably nothing" might connect to other reports
- Investigation is security's job, not yours

When in doubt, report it out.

## ❌ Myth 3: "I should try to fix it myself first"

### ✅ Reality:
DIY incident response often makes things worse:
- You might spread malware to other systems
- You could destroy forensic evidence
- You lack the tools and training for proper response
- Time spent investigating is time malware keeps spreading

Report first, then follow instructions.

## ❌ Myth 4: "Turning off the computer stops the attack"

### ✅ Reality:
Power off destroys critical evidence:
- Memory contains malware artifacts and encryption keys
- Running processes show attack methods
- Network connections reveal attacker infrastructure
- Forensic analysis becomes much harder

Disconnect from network but keep power on unless told otherwise.

---

## ❌ Myth 5: "If nothing bad seems to happen, there's no incident"

### ✅ Reality:
Many attacks are designed to be invisible:
- Advanced malware hides its presence
- Data exfiltration happens quietly
- Attackers establish persistence for later
- The absence of symptoms doesn't mean absence of infection

"Nothing happened" is not the same as "nothing is happening."

---

## ❌ Myth 6: "Only technical problems are security incidents"

### ✅ Reality:
Security incidents include many non-technical events:
- Lost or stolen devices
- Sensitive emails sent to wrong recipients
- Documents left in public places
- Social engineering attempts
- Tailgating and physical intrusions
- Suspicious questions about security

If it threatens data or systems, it's an incident.

---

## ❌ Myth 7: "Security can tell if my computer is compromised remotely"

### ✅ Reality:
Your report provides critical information security may lack:
- User experience details
- Timeline of events
- Context of what happened
- Symptoms that monitoring might miss
- Information that helps prioritize response

Your observations are valuable intelligence.

---

## ❌ Myth 8: "I can wait until tomorrow to report it"

### ✅ Reality:
Every hour of delay increases damage:
- Malware can spread to more systems
- Attackers can exfiltrate more data
- Evidence may be automatically deleted
- Attack scope expands dramatically over time
- Early reporting reduces breach costs by $1.5 million on average

Report immediately—night, weekend, or holiday.

---

## ❌ Myth 9: "Once I report, my job is done"

### ✅ Reality:
You may be needed for follow-up:
- Additional questions about what happened
- Clarification of timeline and actions
- Access to your system for investigation
- Verification of restored services

Stay available and cooperative until cleared.

---

## ❌ Myth 10: "Minor incidents don't need to be reported"

### ✅ Reality:
Small incidents can be symptoms of larger attacks:
- Multiple phishing emails may indicate targeted campaign
- Minor anomalies could be early compromise indicators
- Patterns emerge only when incidents are collected
- What seems minor to you may be critical to investigation

Report everything—let security determine significance.

> 3. **Document everything** - Your observations matter
> 4. **Stay available** - You may be needed for follow-up
> 5. **No blame for reporting** - Quick reporting is always right
>
> Your rapid response makes the difference between incident and disaster.
