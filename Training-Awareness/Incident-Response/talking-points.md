- Data breach or exposure

## First Response Steps

### 1. STOP
- Don't panic
- Don't try to fix it yourself
- Don't turn off the computer (preserves evidence)

### 2. DISCONNECT (if malware)
- Unplug network cable OR
- Disable WiFi
- Prevents spread while preserving evidence

### 3. REPORT IMMEDIATELY

## Post-Report Process
1. **Acknowledgment** - Report received

4. **Containment** - Stop the spread
5. **Recovery** - Restore operations
6. **Follow-up** - Lessons learned
