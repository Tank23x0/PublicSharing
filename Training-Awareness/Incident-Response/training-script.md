# Incident Response Training Script

> **Duration:** ~5 minutes | **Target Audience:** All employees

---

## [INTRO - 0:00-0:30]

**[NARRATOR]**

It's not a matter of IF a security incident will happen—it's WHEN. What you do in the first minutes after discovering an incident can mean the difference between a minor inconvenience and a major disaster.

This training will show you how to recognize security incidents and respond effectively.

## [SECTION 1: What is a Security Incident? - 0:30-1:30]

**[NARRATOR]**

A security incident is any event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our systems and data.

**[ON SCREEN: Incident examples with icons]**

**Common Security Incidents:**
- Receiving a phishing email (and possibly clicking it)
- Malware or ransomware on your computer
- Lost or stolen laptop or mobile device
- Sending sensitive data to the wrong person
- Unauthorized access to systems
- Suspicious account activity
- Physical security breach
- Data exposure or breach

If something seems wrong or unusual, it might be an incident worth reporting.

## [SECTION 2: The First Response - What to Do - 1:30-2:45]

**[NARRATOR]**

Your immediate response matters. Here's what to do:

**[ON SCREEN: Response steps appearing sequentially]**

**STEP 1: STOP**
Don't panic. Don't try to fix it yourself. Don't turn off your computer unless specifically instructed.

**STEP 2: DISCONNECT (If Malware/Ransomware)**
Unplug the network cable or disable WiFi. This prevents spread but preserves evidence.

**STEP 3: REPORT IMMEDIATELY**
Contact IT Security or use the incident reporting hotline. Don't wait to see if it gets worse.

**STEP 4: DOCUMENT**
Write down:
- What happened
- When you noticed it
- What you were doing before
- What you've done since
- Any error messages or unusual behavior

**STEP 5: PRESERVE EVIDENCE**
Don't delete anything. Don't try to "clean up." Evidence is crucial for investigation.

## [SECTION 3: Who to Contact - 2:45-3:30]

**[NARRATOR]**

Know your reporting channels before you need them.

**[ON SCREEN: Contact information display]**

**For Security Incidents:**
- IT Security Hotline: [Insert Number]
- Security Email: security@company.com
- Your Manager (then IT Security)

**For Physical Security:**
- Security Desk: [Insert Number]
- Facilities Emergency Line: [Insert Number]

**For HR-Related Concerns:**
- HR Department: [Insert Number]

When in doubt, call the IT Security hotline first. They'll route you to the right team.

**[ON SCREEN: Urgency indicators]**

**Report IMMEDIATELY for:**
- Ransomware or active malware

## [SECTION 4: What NOT to Do - 3:30-4:15]

**[NARRATOR]**

Avoid these common mistakes that can make incidents worse.

**[ON SCREEN: Red X marks with each point]**

❌ **Don't hide or delay reporting**
"Maybe nobody will notice" makes everything worse.

❌ **Don't investigate on your own**
You might destroy evidence or spread the problem.

❌ **Don't turn off affected computers**
Memory contains valuable forensic evidence.

❌ **Don't discuss the incident broadly**
Tell only those who need to know until cleared to discuss.

❌ **Don't blame or speculate**
Focus on facts, not fault.

❌ **Don't use compromised systems**
If your system might be compromised, stop using it.

## [SECTION 5: After You Report - 4:15-4:30]

**[NARRATOR]**

Once you've reported, here's what happens next:

**[ON SCREEN: Timeline visualization]**

1. **Acknowledgment** - You'll receive confirmation your report was received
2. **Triage** - Security team assesses severity and scope
3. **Investigation** - Forensic analysis begins
4. **Containment** - Steps taken to prevent spread
5. **Follow-up** - You may be contacted for additional information

Your job is to cooperate fully and preserve evidence until cleared.

## [OUTRO - 4:30-5:00]

**[NARRATOR]**

Early reporting is the most important thing you can do during a security incident. The first hour is critical.

Remember:
- Stop what you're doing
- Disconnect if needed
- Report immediately
- Document what happened
- Preserve evidence

You're not expected to fix incidents—you're expected to report them quickly. That's how we minimize damage and recover faster.

**[ON SCREEN: Emergency contacts, "When in doubt, report it out."]**

## Production Notes

- Include organization-specific contact information
- Use scenario-based examples
- Consider including a "decision tree" for different incident types
- Emphasize no-blame culture for reporters
