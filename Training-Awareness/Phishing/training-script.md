## [SECTION 1: What is Phishing? - 0:30-1:30]

**[NARRATOR]**

Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where criminals impersonate trusted entities to trick you into revealing sensitive information.

**[ON SCREEN: Show example phishing email]**

These attacks come in several forms:

**Email Phishing** - Mass emails pretending to be from banks, tech companies, or popular services.

**Spear Phishing** - Targeted attacks using your name, job title, or personal information to appear legitimate.

**Whaling** - High-value attacks targeting executives and senior leadership.

**Smishing** - Phishing via SMS text messages.

**Vishing** - Voice phishing through phone calls.

## [SECTION 2: Red Flags to Watch For - 1:30-3:00]

**[NARRATOR]**

Let's look at the warning signs that scream "this is a phishing attempt."

**[ON SCREEN: Animated checklist appearing]**

**Urgency and Fear Tactics**
"Your account will be suspended in 24 hours!" Attackers want you to panic and act without thinking.

**Suspicious Sender Addresses**
Look closely. It's not "microsoft.com" — it's "micros0ft-support.com" with a zero instead of an O.

**Generic Greetings**
"Dear Customer" or "Dear User" instead of your actual name.

**Grammar and Spelling Errors**
Professional companies proofread their emails. Multiple errors are a red flag.

**Unexpected Attachments**
That "invoice" or "shipping notification" you weren't expecting? Don't open it.

**Hover Before You Click**
Always hover over links to see where they really go. If the URL doesn't match the expected website, don't click.

**Requests for Sensitive Information**
No legitimate company will ask for your password, Social Security number, or full credit card details via email.

## [SECTION 3: What To Do - 3:00-4:00]

**[NARRATOR]**

So what should you do when you spot a suspicious email?

**[ON SCREEN: Action steps with icons]**

**Step 1: STOP** - Don't click any links or download any attachments.

**Step 2: VERIFY** - Contact the supposed sender through official channels—not using any contact info in the email.

**Step 3: REPORT** - Forward the email to your IT security team or use your organization's phishing report button.

**Step 4: DELETE** - Once reported, delete the email from your inbox.

Remember: When in doubt, reach out. It's always better to verify than to become a victim.
