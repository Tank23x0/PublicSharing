# Physical Security Myths vs. Reality

## ❌ Myth 1: "Physical security isn't relevant in a digital world"

### ✅ Reality:
Physical access enables the worst digital attacks:
- Hardware keyloggers capture everything you type
- Stolen laptops expose all their data
- USB drops deliver malware directly
- Server room access can take down entire networks
- Photos of screens capture sensitive information

Physical and digital security are inseparable.

## ❌ Myth 2: "Asking for ID is rude"

### ✅ Reality:
Verifying identity is professional, not rude:
- Security is part of everyone's job
- Legitimate employees and visitors expect it
- A polite challenge is better than a breach
- Real delivery people and contractors have ID

"Hi, can I help you find someone?" is friendly AND secure.

---

## ❌ Myth 3: "Holding the door is just being polite"

### ✅ Reality:
Tailgating is a serious security threat:
- Attackers dress professionally and act confident
- "I forgot my badge" is the oldest trick
- One tailgated entry enables extensive access
- Politeness shouldn't override security

Direct unknown people to reception—it's what reception is for.

## ❌ Myth 4: "Our security guards handle physical security"

### ✅ Reality:
Security guards can't be everywhere:
- Guards can't know every employee by sight
- Social engineers avoid obvious security presence
- Inside threats exist beyond the front desk
- Remote offices may have no guards at all

Every employee is part of the security team.

## ❌ Myth 5: "Nobody would go through our trash"

### ✅ Reality:
Dumpster diving is a real attack technique:
- Sensitive documents, notes, and printouts
- Discarded equipment with data
- Organizational information for social engineering
- Password lists and network diagrams

Shred everything sensitive. What's trash to you is treasure to attackers.

## ❌ Myth 6: "My laptop password protects everything"

### ✅ Reality:
Physical access bypasses many protections:
- Hard drives can be removed and read directly
- Booting from USB bypasses OS password
- Memory forensics can extract encryption keys
- Data recovery from "wiped" drives is common

Full disk encryption helps, but physical security is still essential.

## ❌ Myth 7: "The cleaning crew is harmless"

### ✅ Reality:
After-hours staff have significant access:
- Access to unlocked offices and equipment
- Opportunity to install surveillance devices
- Access to dumpsters and shred bins
- Often not subjected to background checks

Clean desk policy protects against insider threats too.

---

## ❌ Myth 8: "Security cameras prevent crime"

### ✅ Reality:
Cameras are detective, not preventive:
- Cameras record but don't stop attacks in progress
- Footage review happens after the incident
- Blind spots exist in most camera systems
- Determined attackers wear disguises

Cameras help investigate incidents—they don't replace vigilance.

---

## ❌ Myth 9: "I don't need to lock my screen in the office"

### ✅ Reality:
Office environments have risks too:
- Visitors walking through
- Unauthorized employees accessing data
- "Pranks" that expose vulnerabilities
- Compliance requirements don't make exceptions

Lock your screen every time you step away. Windows+L takes one second.

---

## ❌ Myth 10: "Lost badges aren't a big deal"

### ✅ Reality:
Lost badges create serious vulnerabilities:
- Finder may use badge for unauthorized access
- Badge could be cloned or duplicated
- No way to know if badge was lost or stolen
- Attacker could have picked up "dropped" badge

Report lost badges immediately for deactivation.
