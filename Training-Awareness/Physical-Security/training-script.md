## [INTRO - 0:00-0:30]

**[NARRATOR]**

Firewalls and encryption can't stop someone from walking through your front door. Physical security is the foundation that all other security measures are built upon. If an attacker gains physical access to your workplace, all your digital defenses can be bypassed.

Let's explore how to protect our physical environment.

## [SECTION 1: Why Physical Security Matters - 0:30-1:15]

**[NARRATOR]**

Physical security breaches enable some of the most damaging attacks.

**[ON SCREEN: Threat scenarios]**

**What can happen with physical access:**

- Access to unlocked workstations
- Theft from server rooms and data centers
- Dumpster diving for sensitive documents

One stolen laptop can expose thousands of customer records. One unauthorized visitor can plant a device that monitors network traffic for months.

**[NARRATOR]**

Your vigilance is critical to physical security.

**Report immediately:**

## [OUTRO - 4:30-5:00]

Physical security is a team effort. Every badge check, every locked door, every reported stranger makes our workplace safer.

Remember:
- Control access—one badge, one person
