## [INTRO - 0:00-0:30]

**[NARRATOR]**

Imagine arriving at work to find every file on your computer encrypted. A message demands payment in Bitcoin, or your data will be destroyed forever. This isn't a movie plot—this is ransomware, and it's happening to organizations every eleven seconds.

Let's learn how to prevent it from happening to us.

## [SECTION 1: What is Ransomware? - 0:30-1:30]

**[NARRATOR]**

Ransomware is malicious software that encrypts your files and demands payment for the decryption key.

**[ON SCREEN: Ransomware attack visualization]**

Modern ransomware attacks are devastating:
- Files become completely inaccessible
- Attackers threaten to leak sensitive data publicly
- Entire networks can be paralyzed in hours
- Recovery can take weeks or months—even with payment

**[ON SCREEN: Statistics]**

The numbers are alarming:
- Average ransom demand: $1.5 million
- Average total cost of attack: $4.5 million
- 66% of organizations were hit by ransomware last year
- Only 8% who pay get ALL their data back

## [SECTION 2: How Ransomware Spreads - 1:30-2:30]

**[NARRATOR]**

Understanding how ransomware enters your system is the first step to stopping it.

**[ON SCREEN: Attack vectors with icons]**

**Phishing Emails** - The #1 delivery method
An email with a malicious attachment or link. One click, and the infection begins.

**Malicious Downloads**
Fake software updates, pirated software, or infected files from untrusted sources.

**Compromised Websites**
Legitimate websites that have been hacked can silently download malware.

**Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**
Exposed remote access services are constantly scanned and attacked.

**USB Drives**
Infected removable media can spread ransomware when connected.

## [SECTION 3: Prevention Strategies - 2:30-3:45]

**[NARRATOR]**

Here's how you can help prevent ransomware:

**[ON SCREEN: Prevention checklist]**

**Think Before You Click**
Don't open attachments or click links in suspicious emails. Verify unexpected requests.

**Keep Software Updated**
Enable automatic updates. Patches fix security vulnerabilities that ransomware exploits.

**Use Strong, Unique Passwords**
Weak passwords let attackers into systems where they deploy ransomware.

**Back Up Your Data**
Regular backups are your recovery lifeline. Follow the 3-2-1 rule:
- 3 copies of data
- 2 different storage types
- 1 copy offsite or in the cloud

**Be Careful with USB Drives**
Never plug in unknown USB devices. They could be infected.

**Report Suspicious Activity**
Unusual system behavior could be early ransomware activity. Report it immediately.

## [SECTION 4: If You Suspect an Attack - 3:45-4:30]

**[NARRATOR]**

If you think ransomware is on your system, act fast:

**[ON SCREEN: Emergency steps with urgent visual styling]**

**IMMEDIATELY:**

1. **DISCONNECT** from the network—unplug the ethernet cable or disable WiFi
2. **DON'T turn off the computer** (forensic evidence may be needed)
3. **CALL IT Security** immediately—don't try to fix it yourself
4. **DON'T pay the ransom** without consulting security leadership

Early detection can stop ransomware from spreading to other systems. Your quick action could save the entire organization.

## [OUTRO - 4:30-5:00]

**[NARRATOR]**

Ransomware is a business. Attackers calculate their targets, their demands, and their methods. But they depend on one thing: human error.

By staying vigilant—thinking before clicking, keeping systems updated, and reporting suspicious activity—you make our organization a harder target.

Your awareness is our best defense against ransomware.
