# Ransomware Prevention - Key Talking Points

## What is Ransomware?
- Malware that encrypts files and demands payment
- Modern variants also threaten to leak stolen data (double extortion)
- Can spread across entire networks in hours
- Recovery takes weeks/months even when ransom is paid

## Ransomware Statistics
- Attack occurs every 11 seconds
- Average ransom demand: $1.5 million
- Average total cost: $4.5 million
- 66% of organizations hit in past year
- Only 8% who pay get all data back
- 60% of businesses close within 6 months of major attack

## How Ransomware Spreads
1. **Phishing emails** - #1 delivery method (attachments/links)
2. **Malicious downloads** - Fake updates, pirated software
3. **Compromised websites** - Drive-by downloads
4. **Remote Desktop (RDP)** - Exploited remote access
5. **USB drives** - Infected removable media
6. **Supply chain** - Compromised software updates

## Prevention Strategies

### For Employees
- Think before clicking links/attachments
- Verify unexpected email requests
- Report suspicious emails and activity
- Keep personal devices secure
- Don't use unauthorized software
- Never plug in unknown USB drives

### The 3-2-1 Backup Rule
- **3** copies of your data
- **2** different storage types
- **1** copy offsite/cloud

### System Hygiene
- Enable automatic updates
- Use strong, unique passwords with MFA
- Don't disable security software
- Log off when not using workstation

## Warning Signs of Ransomware
- Unusually slow computer performance
- Files won't open or have strange extensions
- Ransom note appears on screen
- Programs launching/closing unexpectedly
- Unusual network activity
- Disabled security software

## If You Suspect Ransomware

### DO:
1. Disconnect from network immediately
2. Call IT Security right away
3. Note what you were doing before symptoms
4. Preserve evidence (don't turn off computer)

### DON'T:
- Don't try to fix it yourself
- Don't turn off the computer
- Don't pay the ransom without authorization
- Don't connect other devices to investigate

## Why NOT to Pay Ransom
- No guarantee data will be recovered
- Encourages more attacks
- May fund criminal/terrorist organizations
- You'll be seen as a "paying target" for future attacks
- May violate OFAC sanctions (legal consequences)

## Key Takeaway
> "Prevention is your job. Recovery is IT's job. Quick reporting makes both easier."
