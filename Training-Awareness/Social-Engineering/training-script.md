> **Duration:** ~5 minutes | **Target Audience:** All employees

## [INTRO - 0:00-0:30]

**[NARRATOR]**

The most sophisticated security system in the world has one critical vulnerability: human nature. Social engineers don't hack computers—they hack people. They exploit trust, helpfulness, fear, and urgency to manipulate us into giving them exactly what they want.

Let's learn how to recognize and defend against these attacks.

## [SECTION 1: What is Social Engineering? - 0:30-1:30]

**[NARRATOR]**

Social engineering is psychological manipulation that tricks people into making security mistakes or giving away sensitive information.

**[ON SCREEN: Definition and examples]**

Unlike technical hacking, social engineering exploits human psychology:
- Our desire to be helpful
- Our respect for authority
- Our fear of negative consequences
- Our tendency to trust familiar things

**[ON SCREEN: Types appearing with icons]**

Common social engineering attacks include:
- **Phishing** - Fake emails impersonating trusted sources
- **Pretexting** - Creating a fabricated scenario to steal information
- **Baiting** - Offering something enticing (free USB drives, downloads)
- **Tailgating** - Following someone through a secure door
- **Quid Pro Quo** - Offering a service in exchange for information

## [SECTION 2: Real-World Tactics - 1:30-3:00]

**[NARRATOR]**

Let's look at how attackers actually operate.

**[ON SCREEN: Scenario dramatizations]**

**The Urgent Request**
An "executive" emails the accounting department: "I'm in a meeting and need you to wire $50,000 immediately. I'll explain later."

**The Helpful IT Person**
Someone calls claiming to be from IT: "We detected malware on your computer. I need your login credentials to clean it remotely."

**The Delivery Person**
A stranger in a delivery uniform asks an employee to hold the door: "My hands are full—can you badge me in?"

**The USB Drop**
A USB drive labeled "Salary Information 2024" is found in the parking lot. Curiosity leads someone to plug it in.

**The Authority Figure**
Someone name-drops senior leadership: "I'm working directly with the CEO on a confidential project. I need access to these files immediately."

## [SECTION 3: Psychological Triggers - 3:00-3:45]

**[NARRATOR]**

Attackers exploit these psychological triggers:

**[ON SCREEN: Triggers with visual representations]**

**Authority** - We comply with authority figures without questioning

**Urgency** - "Do this NOW!" bypasses our critical thinking

**Fear** - Threatening consequences if we don't comply

**Trust** - Pretending to be someone we already trust

**Social Proof** - "Everyone else does this" pressure

**Reciprocity** - Offering something first to create obligation

Recognizing these triggers is your first line of defense.

## [SECTION 4: Defense Strategies - 3:45-4:30]

**[NARRATOR]**

Here's how to protect yourself:

**[ON SCREEN: Defense checklist]**

**Verify Identity** - Call back on a known number. Don't trust caller ID.

**Question Urgency** - Legitimate requests allow time for verification.

**Trust But Verify** - Even if you know the person, confirm unusual requests through a separate channel.

**Follow Procedures** - Security processes exist for a reason. Don't skip them because someone asks.

**Report Suspicious Contact** - If something feels off, it probably is. Report it.

**Never Give Out** - Passwords, security codes, or sensitive information over phone/email without verification.

## [OUTRO - 4:30-5:00]

**[NARRATOR]**

Social engineers succeed because they understand human nature. They count on our helpfulness, our respect for authority, and our fear of confrontation.

Your best defense is a healthy skepticism. It's okay to:
- Say no
- Ask questions
- Verify requests
- Report suspicious behavior

Trust your instincts. If something feels wrong, it probably is.
