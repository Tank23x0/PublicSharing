# Social Engineering - Key Talking Points

## What is Social Engineering?
- Psychological manipulation to exploit human trust
- Targets people, not technology
- Exploits helpfulness, authority, fear, and urgency
- Responsible for 98% of cyberattacks according to some studies

## Types of Social Engineering Attacks

### Phishing
- Fraudulent emails impersonating trusted entities
- Goal: Steal credentials or install malware

### Pretexting
- Creating a fabricated scenario or identity
- Example: "I'm from the audit team and need access to records"

### Baiting
- Offering something enticing to lure victims
- Examples: Infected USB drives, free downloads, fake job offers

### Tailgating/Piggybacking
- Following authorized personnel through secure doors
- Exploits politeness and social norms

### Quid Pro Quo
- Offering a service in exchange for information
- Example: "Free tech support" that requires remote access

### Vishing
- Voice phishing via phone calls
- Often poses as IT support, banks, or government agencies

## Psychological Triggers Exploited
1. **Authority** - We defer to perceived authority figures
2. **Urgency** - Pressure to act quickly bypasses critical thinking
3. **Fear** - Threats create panic and poor decisions
4. **Trust** - Familiarity is exploited
5. **Social Proof** - "Everyone does this"
6. **Reciprocity** - Favors create obligation

## Red Flags to Watch For
- Requests that bypass normal procedures
- Unusual urgency or pressure
- Requests for sensitive information via phone/email
- Name-dropping executives or authority figures
- Unfamiliar people asking for access or information
- Offers that seem too good to be true
- Emotional manipulation (fear, sympathy, flattery)

## Defense Strategies
1. **Verify independently** - Call back on known numbers
2. **Question urgency** - Legitimate requests allow verification time
3. **Follow procedures** - Don't skip security protocols
4. **Report suspicious contact** - Trust your instincts
5. **Never share** - Passwords, codes, or sensitive data without verification
6. **It's OK to say no** - Politeness shouldn't override security

## Key Statistics
- 98% of cyberattacks rely on social engineering
- Average cost of social engineering attack: $130,000
- 43% of IT professionals were targeted in the past year
- Takes average person 4.2 months to realize they were victimized
